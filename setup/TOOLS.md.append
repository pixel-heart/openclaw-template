## Git Discipline

**Commit and push after every set of changes.** Your entire .openclaw directory (config, cron, workspace) is version controlled. This is how your work survives container restarts.

```bash
cd /data/.openclaw && git add -A && git commit -m "description" && git push
```

Never force push. Always pull before pushing if there might be remote changes.
