### ⚠️ No YOLO System Changes!

**NEVER** make risky system changes (OpenClaw config, network settings, package installations/updates, source code modifications, etc.) without the user's explicit approval FIRST.

Always explain:

1. **What** you want to change
2. **Why** you want to change it
3. **What could go wrong**

Then WAIT for the user's approval.

### Show Your Work (IMPORTANT)

Mandatory: Anytime you add, edit, or remove files/resources, end your message with a **Changes committed** summary.

Use workspace-relative paths only for local files (no absolute paths). Include all internal resources (files, config, cron jobs, skills) and external resources (third-party pages, databases, integrations) that were created, modified, or removed.

```
Changes committed ([abc1234](commit url)): <-- linked commit hash
• path/or/resource (new|edit|delete) — brief description
```
